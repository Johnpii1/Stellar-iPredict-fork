# iPredict Database

Shared PostgreSQL schema for the [`backend/`](../backend) and [`indexer/`](../indexer).
SQL migrations live in [`migrations/`](./migrations), applied in filename order.

> **Branch:** all work happens on `implementation-drips`.

## Schema overview

This document is the contributor-facing reference for the core database tables used by the backend and indexer. The current schema covers five tables:

- `markets` — indexed copy of on-chain market data
- `bets` — per-bettor positions per market
- `leaderboard` — denormalized ranking snapshot keyed by wallet address
- `events` — raw on-chain event audit log used for replay and backfills
- `oracle_submissions` — oracle workflow submissions and status tracking

## Table reference

### `markets`

Stores the canonical market metadata that the app reads from the database.

| Column | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `BIGINT` | Primary key; mirrors the on-chain market identifier |
| `question` | `TEXT` | Market question, required |
| `image_url` | `TEXT` | Optional image for the market UI |
| `category` | `VARCHAR(20)` | Market category, used for filtering |
| `end_time` | `BIGINT` | Market resolution deadline, stored as a Unix timestamp |
| `total_yes` | `NUMERIC(30,7)` | Aggregated YES liquidity/volume |
| `total_no` | `NUMERIC(30,7)` | Aggregated NO liquidity/volume |
| `resolved` | `BOOLEAN` | Whether the market has been resolved |
| `outcome` | `BOOLEAN` | Final outcome when resolved; nullable before settlement |
| `cancelled` | `BOOLEAN` | Whether the market was cancelled |
| `creator` | `CHAR(56)` | Wallet address of the market creator |
| `bet_count` | `INTEGER` | Number of recorded bets on the market |
| `created_at` | `TIMESTAMP` | Row creation timestamp |
| `updated_at` | `TIMESTAMP` | Last update timestamp |

Indexes:
- `idx_markets_category` on `category`
- `idx_markets_resolved` on `(resolved, end_time)`
- `idx_markets_active` on `(resolved, cancelled, end_time)`

### `bets`

Stores each bettor’s position for a market. The table is keyed by `(market_id, bettor)` so a user can only have one row per market.

| Column | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `market_id` | `BIGINT` | Foreign key to `markets.id` |
| `bettor` | `CHAR(56)` | Wallet address of the bettor |
| `net_amount` | `NUMERIC(30,7)` | Net amount staked by the bettor |
| `gross_amount` | `NUMERIC(30,7)` | Gross amount recorded for the position |
| `is_yes` | `BOOLEAN` | Whether the position is on the YES side |
| `claimed` | `BOOLEAN` | Whether the payout for the position has been claimed |
| `created_at` | `TIMESTAMP` | Row creation timestamp |

Primary key:
- `(market_id, bettor)`

Index:
- `idx_bets_bettor` on `bettor`

### `leaderboard`

A denormalized ranking snapshot used by the frontend and APIs. It is rebuilt from indexed events when needed.

| Column | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `address` | `CHAR(56)` | Primary key; user wallet address |
| `display_name` | `VARCHAR(50)` | Optional display name |
| `points` | `BIGINT` | Current leaderboard points |
| `won_bets` | `INTEGER` | Count of winning positions |
| `lost_bets` | `INTEGER` | Count of losing positions |
| `updated_at` | `TIMESTAMP` | Last leaderboard update |

Index:
- `idx_lb_points` on `points DESC`

### `events`

Stores raw on-chain event records for auditing, replay, and leaderboard rebuild jobs.

| Column | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `BIGSERIAL` | Auto-incrementing primary key |
| `ledger_seq` | `BIGINT` | Ledger sequence for the originating event |
| `tx_hash` | `CHAR(64)` | Transaction hash |
| `event_type` | `VARCHAR(50)` | Event category such as market creation or bet placement |
| `market_id` | `BIGINT` | Optional market identifier |
| `actor` | `CHAR(56)` | Wallet address of the actor |
| `payload` | `JSONB` | Raw event payload |
| `created_at` | `TIMESTAMP` | Row creation timestamp |

Indexes:
- `idx_events_market` on `market_id`
- `idx_events_type` on `event_type`
- `idx_events_ledger` on `ledger_seq DESC`

### `oracle_submissions`

Tracks oracle submissions for dispute and resolution workflows.

| Column | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `SERIAL` | Auto-incrementing primary key |
| `market_id` | `INTEGER` | Market identifier |
| `submitter` | `VARCHAR(255)` | Wallet address of the submitter |
| `outcome` | `VARCHAR(255)` | Proposed outcome |
| `bond_amount` | `NUMERIC` | Bond attached to the submission |
| `submitted_at` | `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` | Submission timestamp |
| `status` | `oracle_submission_status` | Lifecycle state: `submitted`, `challenged`, `finalized`, or `rejected` |

Indexes:
- `idx_oracle_submissions_market_id` on `market_id`
- `idx_oracle_submissions_status` on `status`

## Migrations

Each migration is a numbered SQL file:

```
migrations/
  0001_create_markets.sql
  0006_oracle_submissions.sql
```

Apply with the migration runner (tracked as its own issue) or manually:

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f db/migrations/0001_create_markets.sql
```

## Local Seed Data

Use the seed script to populate realistic local development records for
`markets`, `bets`, and `leaderboard` without running the full indexer.

```bash
cd db
npm install
npm run seed
```

Defaults to `postgresql://ipredict:ipredict@localhost:5432/ipredict` if
`DATABASE_URL` is not set.

The seed is idempotent:
- Tables are created with `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`
- Records are inserted with `ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE`
- Safe to run multiple times
